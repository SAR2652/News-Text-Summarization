# News-Text-Summarization
Text Summarization is one of the classic problems that can be solved using Natural Language Processing. This project is an attempt towards preprocessing the text data for text summarization and demonstrating the two approaches towards Text Summarization using Natural Language Processing, namely
1. Extractive Summarization
2. Abstractive Summarization
### Extractive Sumarization
The Extractive Summarization aims to select the most important highlights or sentences on the basis of a score that is determined by the count of words and other optional parameters such as the length of a sentence.
### Abstractive Summarization (Work In Progress)
Abstractive Summarization is an attempt towards training the model used for summarization to generate a summary similar to the way a human would do it. This type of a Generative Model can be trained using a Deep Learning based technique known as the **Attention** mechanism.
